<div class="box">
    <p> Black Lives Matter, an ongoing topic that needs change immediately.
        Silence isn't the opiton in times like these, but it's time to stay educated and spread awareness across all platforms.
        Choosing to be silent, is choosing the side of the oppressor.

    <h3 style="color: lightslategrey;"> ALL LIVES WILL MATTER WHEN BLACK LIVES MATTER</h3>
    <p>
         Racial Equality and Justice shouldn't be something we need to fight for but yet some people find it necessary to discriminate based on skin color, gender, beliefs, etc. Of course All Lives Matter, but are all lives in danger? No. We need to fight for the equality of all but especially Black Lives in times like these.

        What is Juneteenth? </p>
        <p>June 19, 1865 marks the day that Major General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas with news that both the American Civil War had ended and the enslaved were to be free. Abraham Lincoln later signed the "Proclamation of Emancipation" freeing the slaves, but the news only arrived in 1865. </p>

        What is Racism ?

    </p>
    <p>  Racism is the belief that a certain race is superior to another, and that a person’s traits automatically predetermine by their inborn characteristics. It’s important to acknowledge when you may be adding on to racial jokes , slurs , or phrases in order to grow from the act. Racism is real, and has been since before 1619.
